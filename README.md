# Southwest-Project
  This project was developed by me to mimic the real Southwest website (https://www.southwest.com) and show the process to rent a car through their website. The main goal of this project was to develop a fully functional website that connects to a live server using PHP. Since the main goal of this project was to connect the front end to the back end, I did not make the webpages responsive.  Most of the items on the webpage are not functional however, I did include some buttons to navigate from page to page. The first webpage is the ‘Registration’ page. This page allows the user to register their information. Once the user hits ‘Continue’, the user’s information will be saved into the database, and they will be assigned a randomly generated reservation number. The user will then be directed to the next page where they will see a webpage that I coded to look like the real southwest website. Once the ‘Search’ button is selected, the user’s destination (San Diego) will be stored, and they will be brought to the next webpage where they can select a car. I have included the top left car as the only one that is clickable and once clicked, the user will be assigned a vehicle and be brought to the next web page where they can see the car details. Once the user is assigned a vehicle, that vehicle will be deleted from the database.
